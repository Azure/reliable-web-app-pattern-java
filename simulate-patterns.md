# Simulate the Patterns

You can test and configure the three code-level design patterns with this implementation: retry, circuit-breaker, and cache-aside. The following paragraphs detail steps to test the three code-level design patterns.

## Retry and Circuit Break Pattern

We built an app configuration setting that lets you simulate and test a transient failure when making a web request to get Service Plans within the Contoso Fiber application. The reference implementation uses `Spring Boot Actuator` to monitor retries. After deploying the application, navigate to your siteâ€™s `/actuator` endpoint to see a list of Spring Boot Actuator endpoints. Navigate to `/actuator/retryevents` to see retried calls. Set the `CONTOSO_RETRY_DEMO` application setting to 1. This will simulate a failure for every web request to get Service plans. A value of 2 generates a 503 error for every other request.

Follow these steps to set up this test:

1. Set the `CONTOSO_RETRY_DEMO` setting to 1 or 2 in the App Service Configuration. The default value of 0 disables the simulated failures.

1. Changing a application setting will cause the App Service to restart. Wait for the app to restart.

1. We added Spring Actuator Dependencies to the Contoso Fiber project. This enables actuator endpoints. Navigate to the following sites.
    * https://<FRONT_DOOR_URL>/actuator
    * https://<FRONT_DOOR_URL>/actuator/retryevents
    * https://<FRONT_DOOR_URL>/actuator/metrics/resilience4j.circuitbreaker.not.permitted.calls

1. Navigate to https://<FRONT_DOOR_URL>/plans/list and refresh the page. Every time you refresh the page, a GET call is made to retrive a list of all service plans.

1. Make note of the retry events and circuit breaker in the actuator endpoints.

## Cache-Aside Pattern

Azure Cache for Redis is a fully managed, open-source compatible in-memory data store that powers fast, high-performing applications, with caching and advanced data structures.

The cache-aside pattern enables us to limit read queries to  the Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server. It also provides a layer of redundancy that can keep parts of our application running in the event of issue with Azure PostgreSQL Database.

For more information, see [cache-aside pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/cache-aside).

Using the Redis Console we can see that we are caching objects and http sessions from Contoso Fiber in Redis.

# Logs

Application logging is enabled. To view the logs, navigate to *Diagnose and solve problems*. From there, click on *Application Logs*.

## Auto Scaling

Auto scaling is enabled and the default instance count is set to 2. To view the auto scaling settings, navigate to *Scale out (App Service plan)*.

![Scale out](./docs/assets/appservice-scale-out.png)

Click on *Manage Rules Based Settings* to view the auto scaling rules.

![Scale out rules](./docs/assets/appservice-autoscale-rules.png)

These rules are defined in *Terraform* as follows:

```
resource "azurerm_monitor_autoscale_setting" "app_service_scaling" {
  name                = "contosocamsscaling"
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group
  location            = var.location
  target_resource_id  = azurerm_service_plan.application.id
  profile {
    name = "default"
    capacity {
      default = 2
      minimum = 2
      maximum = 10
    }
    rule {
      metric_trigger {
        metric_name         = "CpuPercentage"
        metric_resource_id  = azurerm_service_plan.application.id
        time_grain          = "PT1M"
        statistic           = "Average"
        time_window         = "PT5M"
        time_aggregation    = "Average"
        operator            = "GreaterThan"
        threshold           = 85
      }
      scale_action {
        direction = "Increase"
        type      = "ChangeCount"
        value     = "1"
        cooldown  = "PT1M"
      }
    }
    rule {
      metric_trigger {
        metric_name         = "CpuPercentage"
        metric_resource_id  = azurerm_service_plan.application.id
        time_grain          = "PT1M"
        statistic           = "Average"
        time_window         = "PT5M"
        time_aggregation    = "Average"
        operator            = "LessThan"
        threshold           = 65
      }
      scale_action {
        direction = "Decrease"
        type      = "ChangeCount"
        value     = "1"
        cooldown  = "PT1M"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Application Insights

Exceptions in the Contoso Fiber CAMS web application are reported with Application Insights.

Click on an exception to see the end-to-end details:

Navigate to the Live Metrics blade to see real-time performance:

## Resiliency with Multi-Region

The Contoso Fiber CAMS web application is deployed in two regions. All traffic is initially routed to the primary region. In the event of an outage in the active region, traffic can be routed to the secondary region. This proccess in not automatic and requires manual intervention.

![image of Azure Front Door Origin Group](./docs/assets/front-door-origin-group.png)

An **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server** is in the secondary region. This database is a read replica of the primary database. In the event of an outage in the primary region, the application can continue to function using the secondary database. For more information on read replicas, see [Read replicas in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-read-replicas).
