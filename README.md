The reference implementation provides a production-grade web application that uses best practices from our guidance and gives developers concrete examples to build their own Reliable Web Application in Azure. This repository specifically demonstrates a Customer Account Management System (CAMS) application for the fictional company Contoso Fiber, embodying the reliable web app pattern with a focus on Java technologies. It guides developers through a simulated migration from an on-premises web application to Azure, detailing the architectural changes and enhancements that capitalize on the cloud's strengths during the initial adoption phase. 

This project has [a companion article in the Azure Architecture Center](https://aka.ms/eap/rwa/java/doc) and [self-paced workshop](./workshop/README.md) that describes design patterns and best practices that details the reliable web app pattern for Java web app. 

Here's an outline of the contents in this readme:

## Architecture

Contoso Fiber aligned to a hub and spoke network topology in the production deployment architecture to centralize common resources. This network topology provided cost savings, enhanced security, and facilitated network integration (platform and hybrid):

![Architecture](./docs/icons/reliable-web-app-java.svg)

This diagram describes the production deployment which is described in the [prod-deployment.md](./prod-deployment.md) file. The following steps below are for a [development deployment](./docs/icons/reliable-web-app-java-dev.svg) which is a simplified version.

-	Cost efficiency: The hub acts as a central point for shared resources, promoting cost-effective resource reuse. For instance, Azure Bastion is a shared service in the hub, providing secure and cost-effective remote access without the need for separate deployments for each application.
-	Traffic control and security: Network traffic is managed and secured using Network Security Groups and Route tables in each subnet, creating secure boundaries for Azure resources. Private endpoints add an extra layer of security, and a Jump Box allows for deployment within these boundaries, maintaining local IP access to resources.
-	Network integration: The topology supports network integrations for data transfer across applications and hybrid scenarios. While the reference architecture doesn't include ExpressRoute or Azure VPN Gateway, these should be considered for applications requiring hybrid network connections.

## Workflow

This description details the workflow for Contoso Fiber's CAMs application. It highlights key components and functionality to help you emulate its design:
 
- Global traffic routing: Azure Front Door acts as a global traffic manager, routing users to the primary region for optimal performance and failing over to a secondary region during outages for uninterrupted service.
- Security inspection: Incoming traffic is inspected by Azure Web Application Firewall to protect against web vulnerabilities before reaching the web app.
- Static and dynamic content delivery: Users receive static content, like the home page, immediately upon request. Dynamic content, such as the 'Support Case' page, are generated by making SQL calls to the backend, which fetches data from Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server.
- Session state management: User sessions are managed by Azure Cache for Redis, ensuring persistence and consistency across scale-out events.
- User authentication: Microsoft Entra ID handles user authentication, suitable for environments where accounts are centrally managed, enhancing security and control.
- Networking and access control: Azure Private DNS, Network Security Groups, and Azure Firewall tightly control the flow of traffic within the app's network, maintaining security and isolation.
- Monitoring and telemetry: Application Insights provides monitoring and telemetry capabilities, enabling performance tracking and proactive issue resolution.
- Configuration and secrets management: Initial configuration and sensitive information are loaded from Azure Key Vault into the app's memory upon startup, minimizing access to sensitive data thereafter.

## Steps to deploy the reference implementation

The following detailed deployment steps assume you are using a Dev Container inside Visual Studio Code.

> For your convenience, we use Dev Containers with a fully-featured development environment. If you prefer to use another editor, we recommend installing the necessary [dependencies](./prerequisites.md) and skip to the deployment instructions starting in [Step 3](#3-log-in-to-azure).

### 1. Clone the repo

> For Windows users, we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to [improve Dev Container performance](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/improve-performance).

```pwsh
wsl
```

Clone the repository and open the project using the Dev Container.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure/reliable-web-app-pattern-java.git

cd reliable-web-app-pattern-java
```

### 2. Open Dev Container in Visual Studio Code

If required, ensure Docker Desktop is started. Open the repository folder in Visual Studio Code. You can do this from the command prompt:

```shell
code .
```

Once Visual Studio Code is launched, you should see a popup allowing you to click on the button **Reopen in Container**.

![Reopen in Container](docs/assets/vscode-reopen-in-container.png)

If you don't see the popup, open the Visual Studio Code Command Palette to execute the command. There are three ways to open the command palette:

- For Mac users, use the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘P
- For Windows and Linux users, use Ctrl+Shift+P
- From the Visual Studio Code top menu, navigate to View -> Command Palette.

Once the command palette is open, search for `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.

### 3. Log in to Azure

Before deploying, you must be authenticated to Azure and have the appropriate subscription selected. Run the following command to authenticate:

```shell
az login --scope https://graph.microsoft.com//.default
```

Set the subscription to the one you want to use (you can use [az account list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-account-list) to list available subscriptions):

```shell
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscription-id>"
```

```pwsh
az account set --subscription $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

Use the next command to login with the Azure Dev CLI (AZD) tool:

```pwsh
azd auth login
```

### 4. Create a new environment

Next we provide the AZD tool with variables that it uses to create the deployment. The first thing we initialize is the AZD environment with a name.

The environment name should be less than 18 characters and must be comprised of lower-case, numeric, and dash characters (for example, `contosowebapp`).  The environment name is used for resource group naming and specific resource naming.

By default, Azure resources are sized for a development deployment. If doing a production deployment, see the [production deployment](./prod-deployment.md) instructions for more detail.

```shell
azd env new <pick_a_name>
```

Select the subscription that will be used for the deployment:
```shell
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

Set the Azure region to be used:

```shell
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <pick_a_region>
```

Optional: Set the App Registration Service Management Reference:

```shell
azd env set AZURE_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_REFERENCE <service_management_reference>
```

### 5. Create the Azure resources and deploy the code

Run the following command to create the Azure resources and deploy the code (about 15-minutes to complete):

```shell
azd up
```

### 6. Open and use the application

Navigate to the Front Door URL in a browser to view the Contoso Fiber CAMS application. Use the Endpoint URL from the output of the deployment.

You will see an output similar to the following:

```shell
Deploying services (azd deploy)

  (✓) Done: Deploying service application
  - Endpoint: https://fd-contosocams-dev-frcfgefndcctbgdh.z02.azurefd.net
```

You can learn more about the web app by reading the [Pattern Simulations](demo.md) documentation.

### 7. Tear down the deployment

Run the following command to tear down the deployment:

```pwsh
azd down --purge --force
```
